# Object-Detection-Resnet
Identification and Classification of Objects in Images

1) Firstly we will preprocess the images collected from our datasets and then train our model.

2) After our model has been trained it will be saved in our system with a .h5 extension

3) In order to test our image we will load our model from the disk

4) We will browse our test image via User Interface of our project.






After the image has been browsed we will press the Detect button which will check whether the object of interest is present in our test image or not.

If the object of interest is present it will display the object name trained in our classifier else it will display not the object of interest.

After detecting the object of interest the user can press Classify button to save the test image and sort it from the dataset.

A reset button is also provided which help user to test a new image or if he/she has mistakenly chosen wrong image via Browse button.

The quit button in the end closes up the session with a message “You want to quit?”
